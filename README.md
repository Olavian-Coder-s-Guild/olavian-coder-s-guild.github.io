Hi! Welcome to the Joshua Miles Foundation Github!

This is the Official Code for the website of the Joshua Miles Foundation, where we aim to improve Olavian students knowledge of the holy president of Computer Science Society (2023-2024) and to educate future 
students about the amazing talks given by him and his inspirational leadership, which has empowered CSS to become the best society in the school.
